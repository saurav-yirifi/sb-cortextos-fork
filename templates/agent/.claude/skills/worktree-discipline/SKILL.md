# Worktree discipline (shared-repo coordination)

The framework repos at `/Volumes/MacStorage/UserData/0devprojects/sb-cortextos-fork` and `/Volumes/MacStorage/UserData/0devprojects/sb-claude-jarvis` are **shared working trees** — multiple agents and the user may be operating in them at any moment. Branch operations there silently corrupt other agents' uncommitted state. See `.claude/rules/code-quality/same-repo-multi-agent-checkout-contamination.md`.

**Never edit, commit, or checkout feature branches in the canonical tree.** Use a per-agent worktree.

## Convention

`~/cortextos-worktrees/<your-agent-name>/<branch>` (or `~/jarvis-worktrees/...`).

## Workflow when starting any non-trivial code task

```bash
# 1. Fetch from canonical (read-only ops there are fine)
cd /Volumes/MacStorage/UserData/0devprojects/sb-cortextos-fork
git fetch origin main

# 2. Create your worktree on a fresh branch off origin/main
git worktree add ~/cortextos-worktrees/$CTX_AGENT_NAME/<branch-name> -b <branch-name> origin/main

# 3. cd in and work there for the entire feature lifecycle
cd ~/cortextos-worktrees/$CTX_AGENT_NAME/<branch-name>
# ... edit, build, test, commit, push, PR, evaluator cycle ...

# 4. After PR is merged, clean up
cd /Volumes/MacStorage/UserData/0devprojects/sb-cortextos-fork
git worktree remove ~/cortextos-worktrees/$CTX_AGENT_NAME/<branch-name>
```

The canonical tree is read-only for you — `git fetch`, `git pull origin main`, `git log`, `git status` against main are fine; everything else (checkout, edit, commit, push) goes through your worktree.

## Recovery

- Worktree dir already exists from a prior PR: `git worktree list` to inspect, `git worktree remove --force <path>` if stale.
- Same branch name taken by another agent: pick a different name.
- After daemon restart, ALWAYS `git branch --show-current` immediately before commit — restarts reset implicit branch state and prior commits can land on a sibling agent's branch silently.

## Why this matters

Two distinct contamination shapes the rule prevents:
1. **Branch-checkout discards uncommitted work.** Agent A is mid-edit on branch X; agent B `git checkout Y` either fails or carries A's edits onto Y silently.
2. **Daemon-restart respawns on wrong branch.** Session loses implicit branch state; subsequent commits land on whatever was checked out at restart time, not what the agent intended.
