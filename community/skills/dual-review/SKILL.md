# dual-review

Two code reviewers, in parallel, with disciplined reconciliation. Spawns the project-aware Claude `code-evaluator` subagent AND runs `codex review` (OpenAI Codex CLI) on the same diff. Reconciles findings (both / Claude-only / Codex-only) and surfaces a triaged punch list. The invoking agent then classifies each finding FIX / DISMISS-with-reason / ESCALATE.

The two evaluators are complements, not substitutes. Claude's `code-evaluator` reads project CLAUDE.md and `.claude/rules/`; Codex doesn't. Codex catches generic-best-practice patterns Claude over-tunes-out as "project convention." Combining cuts blind spots; reconciliation prevents oscillation between the two.

**Trigger phrases:**
- "run dual review"
- "/dual-review"
- "/dual-review <PR#>"

---

## When to use

- Before opening a PR — get the dual perspective before reviewers see it.
- On a tricky commit you're not sure about — sanity-check from two angles.
- When `code-evaluator` returned LGTM but the change touches sensitive code (auth, data, money) — Codex may catch what the project-tuned reviewer normalized.
- Before requesting merge approval on a high-risk change.

**When NOT to use:**
- On every commit. The eval-cost compounds; reserve for milestones.
- On trivial diffs (typos, formatting). Use plain `code-evaluator` if anything.
- As a substitute for `pr-deep-evaluator` on multi-phase PRs. They answer different questions: dual-review reads the diff; pr-deep-evaluator reads the PR's full structure (description, phases, wiring).

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Codex CLI must be installed
if ! command -v codex >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "codex CLI not installed; falling back to claude-only review"
  FALLBACK=1
fi

# AND authenticated — use exit code, not output text
# (different auth modes return different output strings; exit code is stable)
if [ -z "$FALLBACK" ] && ! codex login status >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "codex not authenticated; falling back to claude-only review"
  FALLBACK=1
fi

# Add reviews/ to .gitignore if not already there — keeps session artifacts out of fix-commits
if ! grep -qE '^reviews/?$' .gitignore 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "reviews/" >> .gitignore
fi
```

If `FALLBACK=1`, the skill runs only Stage 1a (Claude evaluator) and skips Stage 1b (Codex). The reconciliation stage degrades to "single-evaluator triage."

To install codex: `npm install -g @openai/codex` then `codex login`. The plugin (`openai/codex-plugin-cc`) is NOT required — this skill invokes the CLI directly via bash so it works regardless of plugin install state.

---

## Setup

Determine the session dir, default branch, and get the diff:

```bash
PR_NUM="${1:-branch}"
TS=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%SZ)               # full UTC timestamp — multiple runs/day don't overwrite
SESSION_DIR="reviews/dual-${PR_NUM}-${TS}"
mkdir -p "$SESSION_DIR"

# Detect default branch — don't assume `main`
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null \
  | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')
DEFAULT_BRANCH="${DEFAULT_BRANCH:-main}"      # fallback only if detection fails

if [ "$PR_NUM" = "branch" ]; then
  BASE="$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
  git diff "$BASE" > "$SESSION_DIR/diff.txt"
else
  BASE=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUM" --repo "$GH_REPO" --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName)
  HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUM" --repo "$GH_REPO" --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)

  # Both evaluators must see the SAME diff. Check out the PR head first
  # so working-tree state is deterministic across both evaluators.
  git fetch origin "+refs/pull/${PR_NUM}/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/${PR_NUM}"
  git checkout "$HEAD_SHA"

  gh pr diff "$PR_NUM" --repo "$GH_REPO" > "$SESSION_DIR/diff.txt"
fi
```

**Working-tree contract:** both evaluators derive their diff from current git state, not from `$SESSION_DIR/diff.txt`. The captured diff file is for audit only. To prove both evaluators see the same change set, the skill checks out the PR head before invoking either. For branch mode, the working tree must be at the branch tip with no unrelated unstaged changes — the skill aborts if `git diff "$BASE"` differs from `git diff "$BASE" HEAD`.

If the diff is empty, tell the user there's nothing to review and stop.

---

## Stage 1a: Claude `code-evaluator` subagent (project-aware)

Spawn the `code-evaluator` subagent. Its prompt:

```
Review the diff at $SESSION_DIR/diff.txt for correctness, error paths,
tests, naming, and architectural fit against project CLAUDE.md and
.claude/rules/.

For each finding, write:

## <severity>: <one-line summary>
**File:** path:line
**Issue:** specific problem
**Suggested fix:** concrete change

Severities: BLOCKER / SHOULD-FIX / NIT.

End with `LGTM` if no findings.

Write your output to $SESSION_DIR/claude-review.md.
```

This runs in parallel with Stage 1b (don't wait).

## Stage 1b: Codex review

```bash
if [ -z "$FALLBACK" ]; then
  # Always use --base to evaluate the FULL diff (not just the tip commit).
  # Multi-commit PRs would otherwise have Stage 1a (full PR diff) and Stage 1b
  # (tip commit only) reviewing different change sets, breaking reconciliation.
  codex review --base "$BASE" > "$SESSION_DIR/codex-review.md" 2>&1
fi
```

For PR mode, the Setup stage already checked out the PR head — `--base "$BASE"` then evaluates HEAD..base, which is the full PR diff. For branch mode, working tree is at the branch tip, same outcome.

Codex output is free-form text, not structured. The reconciliation stage parses it.

Run in parallel with Stage 1a.

---

## Stage 2: Reconciliation

Once both finish, read both files and produce a merged punch list.

Reconciliation prompt for the invoking agent (no separate subagent):

```
Read $SESSION_DIR/claude-review.md and $SESSION_DIR/codex-review.md.

Produce a merged punch list at $SESSION_DIR/merged.md with this structure:

## Both flag (high confidence)
- file:line — issue summary
  - Claude: <quote>
  - Codex: <quote>

## Claude only (project-rule signal)
- file:line — issue summary
  - Claude: <quote>
  - Codex: silent — likely tuned-in to project convention Codex doesn't know.

## Codex only (blind-spot signal — investigate)
- file:line — issue summary
  - Codex: <quote>
  - Claude: silent — investigate whether this is a real blind spot or a generic
    rule that doesn't apply to this project.

Where Codex and Claude flag overlapping issues with different framing,
combine them under "Both flag" with both quotes preserved.
```

The invoking agent does this reconciliation in its own context (cheap; no subagent spawn). The output is a single file the agent reads next.

---

## Stage 3: Disciplined triage

For each finding in `$SESSION_DIR/merged.md`, the invoking agent explicitly classifies:

- **FIX** — apply the change now in a fix-commit. Append to `$SESSION_DIR/triage.md` as `FIX: <file:line> — <reason>`.
- **DISMISS** — finding is not applicable to this project / context / change. Append to `$SESSION_DIR/triage.md` as `DISMISS: <file:line> — <reason>`. The reason is mandatory — "doesn't apply" is not a reason; "Codex flags missing null-check on `req.userId` but the type guard at line 12 already proved it non-null" is.
- **ESCALATE** — finding is real but the right resolution requires Saurav input. Append to `$SESSION_DIR/triage.md` as `ESCALATE: <file:line> — <question>`. Surface via Telegram or boss-relay.

**Why disciplined dismissal matters:**

Without explicit classification, the agent oscillates: Codex says remove, Claude says keep, agent removes, next cycle Codex re-flags as missing, agent restores. Infinite loop, zero progress. The triage file is the audit record that lets you see "we already considered and dismissed this" without re-litigating.

If the same finding gets dismissed twice across separate dual-review runs on the same code, escalate to Saurav — repeated dismissal of the same flag is a smell.

---

## Stage 4: Apply fixes + commit

Apply all FIX-classified findings in one fix-commit:

```bash
# git add -u stages tracked files only — keeps reviews/ session artifacts out
# of the fix-commit (the .gitignore from Prerequisites also prevents accidents).
git add -u
git commit -m "$(cat <<EOF
fix: dual-review feedback

Addresses N findings flagged by Claude code-evaluator and/or Codex.
Triage: $SESSION_DIR/triage.md.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

ESCALATE findings stay open until Saurav responds. DISMISS findings are recorded but require no action.

---

## Output structure

After running, the session dir contains:

```
reviews/dual-<PR>-<DATE>/
  diff.txt              # the diff that was reviewed
  claude-review.md      # raw Claude code-evaluator output
  codex-review.md       # raw Codex review output (or empty if FALLBACK)
  merged.md             # reconciled punch list (Both / Claude-only / Codex-only)
  triage.md             # FIX / DISMISS-with-reason / ESCALATE classifications
```

This is the audit trail. Future dual-reviews on the same code can grep `triage.md` files to see prior dismissals.

---

## Cost notes

- Claude `code-evaluator` subagent: one Claude call. Counts against the agent's context budget.
- Codex review: one OpenAI API call (or ChatGPT subscription quota).
- Total per run: ~2 evaluator calls. Reserve for milestones, not every commit.
- For large diffs (>1000 lines), consider running `code-evaluator` per-file instead of on the whole diff. Codex handles large diffs better; it's optimized for full-PR review.

---

## Anti-patterns

- **Running dual-review on every commit.** Cost compounds; LGTM rate drops to noise. Use per-milestone.
- **Applying all Codex suggestions without dismissal review.** The oscillation trap — Codex doesn't know your project conventions; some of its "fixes" make your code less consistent.
- **Skipping the triage stage.** Without explicit FIX/DISMISS/ESCALATE classification, the audit record is missing and the next run re-litigates everything.
- **Running dual-review then only acting on Claude's output.** Defeats the purpose; you spent the Codex call for nothing.
- **Treating Codex silence as approval.** Codex didn't read your CLAUDE.md; it doesn't know what to flag. Silence from Codex on a project-rule violation isn't agreement, it's ignorance.
- **Treating Claude silence as approval on cross-project patterns.** Claude over-tunes to project convention; some generic anti-patterns get normalized as "the way we do it here."
